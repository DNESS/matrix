## Requirements
* prggmr >= 0.3.1

## Running

To run simply use the command

    prggmr matrix.php

## Performance

This is a pretty damn resource intensive my tests reveal the following,

Note this was done on a T7200 2.0GHZ machine which is outdated in processor terms ... 
you might get better results :)

COLSxROWS

* 80x30
15% CPU Usage

* 100*50
20% CPU Usage

* 175x65
35% CPU Usage

## How it works

It's simple really ... I create a very large array containing each node in a box,
keep track of what nodes must be a space, a white color and a regular char.

For movement I simply extract the previous into the current, keep track of the
movement positions, add some randomness and I have movement.

Put it all together in an interval, time it right ... and thats it!
